# Furniture Design Studio

A Java Swing application for designing and visualizing furniture layouts in rooms with 2D and 3D capabilities.

## Overview

Furniture Design Studio is an interactive desktop application that enables designers to create, edit, save, and visualize furniture layouts within room spaces. The application features both 2D and 3D visualization capabilities, allowing designers to create professional interior designs with ease.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login system with MongoDB backend storage
- **2D Design Canvas**: Interactive canvas for placing and arranging furniture items
- **3D Visualization**: View designs in 3D with realistic furniture rendering
- **Room Customization**: Adjust room dimensions and appearance
- **Furniture Library**: Selection of common furniture types (chairs, tables, sofas, beds, cabinets)
- **Design Management**: Save, load, and modify design projects
- **Intuitive UI**: Modern and user-friendly interface with drag-and-drop functionality

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: Java 21
- **UI Framework**: Java Swing
- **Build Tool**: Gradle
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted)
- **Dependencies**:
  - Spring Boot 3.2.0 (core functionality)
  - MongoDB Java Driver 4.10.2
  - JSON library 20231013

## Installation Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or higher
- Internet connection for MongoDB authentication
- Gradle 8.0+ (included as wrapper)

## MongoDB Configuration

The application uses MongoDB Atlas for data storage. The connection string and database name are configured in `src/main/java/org/example/group-101-hci-furniture-studio/auth/MongoDBConnector.java`.

You can replace the connection string with your own MongoDB instance by modifying:

```java
private static final String CONNECTION_STRING = "connection_string_from_report";
private static final String DATABASE_NAME = "database_name";
```

For security purposes, in a production environment, it's recommended to store the connection string in environment variables or a configuration file that is not committed to version control.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project root directory
3. Build the application:
   ```
   ./gradlew build
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```
   
   Alternatively, you can run the generated jar:
   ```
   java -jar build/libs/HCI-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

## Test User Credentials

For testing purposes, you can use the following pre-configured user accounts:
